                <p><strong>Target Release:</strong> December 2025</p>
                <p>This personal project focuses on the creation of a sliding puzzle game, "Sliders". Players can choose from difficulty levels with grid sizes ranging from 3x3 (easiest) to 7x7 (hardest).</p>
                <p>The goal is to slide the numbered tiles into a specific randomized order, which is different for each game played. The numbered tiles don't need to be in a numerical sequence; the order will vary with each new game.</p>
                <p>Built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, the game offers an engaging challenge with various levels of complexity, suitable for both beginners and puzzle enthusiasts.</p>

                <p>"Jumbled Blockers" is a fun and brain-stimulating puzzle game where the objective is to arrange colored discs onto matching color-coded poles.</p>
                <p>Players can only move the top disc on any pole, and they can only move one disc at a time. The game allows players to choose difficulty by selecting how many poles to sort discs from, ranging from 4 to 7 poles.</p>
                <p>The challenge is to sort all the discs by color in as few moves as possible while keeping track of limited pole capacity and order restrictions. Each puzzle is timed, adding an extra layer of competition.</p>
