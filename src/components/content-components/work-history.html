                <h3>Software Development Engineer Intern @ Amazon</h3>
                <p class="date-text">June 2025 – September 2025</p>
                <p>During my internship at Amazon, I developed a centralized log monitoring system for the AWS Audit Manager team. My responsibility was to design and document the architecture, ensuring long-term maintainability while providing a clear implementation strategy. The monitoring system I developed was able to aggregate log data from multiple AWS regional accounts, significantly reducing authentication overhead and optimizing operational efficiency across the board. Additionally, I designed and implemented unit tests using a mocking framework to ensure over 90% code coverage. This experience gave me in-depth exposure to AWS services such as Lambda, CloudWatch, and CloudFormation, as well as cloud architecture best practices.</p>

                <p class="date-text">March 2025</p>
                <p>At the University of Washington's Nanofabrication Facility, I had the opportunity to work on a semiconductor engineering project, specifically focusing on the development of silicon wafers. I participated in nanofabrication processes such as lithography, etching, and inspection, and was involved in creating essential components like capacitors, diodes, and resistors. My work in this cleanroom environment allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience with materials used in advanced electronics manufacturing.</p>

                <p class="date-text">December 2024 – January 2025</p>
                <p>This project focused on analyzing New York City's (NYC) transportation and crash rates using Python and Google Colab. I examined various collision data sets, including accident types, locations, and main crash contributing factors. Using these insights, I created visualizations to highlight trends and areas needing improvement. I then developed a research poster to showcase my findings, with recommendations for the Department of Transportation to reduce accidents in the future and enhance safety on NYC's roads.</p>

                <p>Selected as one of only 78 students out of over 5,000 applicants, I participated in Jane Street's prestigious AMP program, where I developed advanced problem-solving and algorithmic skills. Throughout the program, I tackled a range of programming challenges, including learning how to code logical puzzles and strategy-based games. Additionally, I took part of an Electronic Trading Competition in this program, where I designed a Python-based trading algorithm to maximize simulated stock market profits. This experience deepened my understanding of algorithm design and the transformative role of automation in financial markets.</p>

                <p class="date-text">July 2023 – August 2023</p>
                <p>At Fred Hutch, I contributed to cancer research by applying computational biology and data analysis concepts to identify the frequent causes of cancer. Using the R programming language, I analyzed genetic data and worked with patient datasets to discover meaningful insights. My project specifically focused on analyzing mutations in the TP53 (Tumor Protein) gene, where I explored how missense and nonsense mutations in this gene impact tumor growth and affect patient survival rates.</p>
